### Hey there!

My name is lukedev820 but Luke is also fine! I’m a student that enjoys learning more about technology and programming.

On this website I usually post what I’ve been working on, what I’m learning and my thoughts and experiences on technology. Even if no one sees this blog I’ll still be glad I can see how I have progressed and maybe someone will stumble across it and find it useful.
