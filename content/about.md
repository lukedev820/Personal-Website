### Random Facts About Me 🎲

- My <a href="https://lukedev820.github.io/Three.js-basic-setup/">silly Three.js experiment</a> was so well liked by my friends it's still visited by them months after it's creation. Thats also the reason its been my profile picture all this time, it encapsulates my creativity and passion for my work.
- I tutored one of my classmate's Python well enough that her parents paid me for my time. She went from knowing nothing to passing the unit so I must have done a good job 😅.
