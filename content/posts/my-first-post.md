Hello World! If you and me are able to read this I have successfully made a blog using Hugo!

A hello world is pretty boring on its own so allow me to introduce myself.
 
I'm Luke Lipscombe, and I am currently a student who likes to self teach programming in my spare time. I use Linux as my daily driver and i have been for about 2 years at the time of writing this.

In these blog posts I want to share my programming journey and the projects i make.

I also just realised this is my first ever blog post. Thanks for reading!
