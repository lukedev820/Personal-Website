When I switched from a nicer looking but harder to maintain website to this modified hugo theme, I wanted share it with friends and family for feedback. Not even 5 days later my domain gets taken down with no warning or notice. I contacted my domain registrar and after some back and fourth they told me to contact .xyz to get my domain unsuspended. Once I contacted .xyz I got my domain unsuspended the next day and I thought it was the end of it but I was far from correct. I have just had my domain unsuspended for a third time in the span of 30 days and I'm not getting any solid answer as to why apart from "SMS Phishing".

I have no idea why my domain keeps getting flagged but its infuriating because I don't find out until I go to show my website to someone just to find its been purged from existence. I could just remove my domain and use the default url provided by github pages but it's too lengthy, hard to remember, and github is blocked by my schools firewall ðŸ˜….
