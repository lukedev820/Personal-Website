    </header><p>When I switched from a nicer looking but harder to maintain website to this modified hugo theme, I wanted share it with friends and family for feedback. Not even 5 days later my domain gets taken down with no warning or notice. I contacted my domain registrar and after some back and fourth they told me to contact .xyz to get my domain unsuspended. Once I contacted .xyz I got my domain unsuspended the next day and I thought it was the end of it but I was far from correct. I have just had my domain unsuspended for a third time in the span of 30 days and I&rsquo;m not getting any solid answer as to why apart from &ldquo;SMS Phishing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have no idea why my domain keeps getting flagged but its infuriating because I don&rsquo;t find out until I go to show my website to someone just to find its been purged from existence. I could just remove my domain and use the default url provided by github pages but it&rsquo;s too lengthy, hard to remember, and github is blocked by my schools firewall 😅.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve had a similar experience and or know how to avoid this from happening please feel free to <a href="mailto:raidernight920@gmail.com?subject=Possible solution to your domain troubles">send me an email.</a></p>
